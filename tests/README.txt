This directory contains only Mathomatic scripts. They include tests,
examples, short tutorials, and educational math toys.

	To run all of the tests on a Unix compatible system
        and check their output, type "./t".

	To run a specific script, type "mathomatic script-name",
        or "read script-name" from within Mathomatic.

	To run a specific script, and create a complete HTML output file
	from it, type "./demo script-name".

Look around and have fun! Feel free to contribute your Mathomatic scripts.
Here are the good examples and lessons that are available in this directory:

 all.in - script that reads in all test scripts
 circles.in - uses eliminate command to combine the equations for 2 circles
 collatz.in - the Collatz conjecture as an equation
 cubic.in - calculate the 3 solutions of any cubic polynomial equation
 cubic2.in - general cubic polynomial formula using 2 equations
 demo.in - a demonstration of differentiation and Taylor series
 distance.in - derive the shortest distance between a point and a line in 2D
 electronics.in - a few electrical formulas
 ellipse.in - 2D equations for ellipses
 examples.in - some simple examples of Mathomatic in action
 fibonacci.in - direct formula to calculate phi and any Fibonacci number
 finance.in - derivation of the present value annuity formula
 fraction.in - shows how "simplify fraction" and "unfactor fraction" work
 heart.in - plot a heart with gnuplot
 heron.in - tutorial for the area formula of any triangle and derivations
 how_limit_works.in - how the experimental limit command works
 linear.in - combine 3 simultaneous linear equations with 3 unknowns
 pie.in - how to approximate the universal constants pi and e
 points.in - derive simple equations from 2 or 3 points in 2 dimensions
 poly.in - combine 3 quadratic equations with 3 unknown coefficients
 pyth3d.in - arrives at the distance between two points in 3D space
 quadratic.in - derives the general quadratic (2nd degree polynomial) formula
 quartic.in - calculate the 4 solutions of quartic polynomial equations
 radius.in - some fun formulas for the radius of a circle

Some "rmath" (or "matho") only scripts:

 trig - creates an equation for each trigonometry function
 batman_plot - Batman equations plot the Batman logo

Install m4 Mathomatic and type "rmath script-name" to run rmath scripts.
