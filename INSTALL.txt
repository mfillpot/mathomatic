                      Mathomatic Installation Instructions
                      ------------------------------------

The requirements for easy installation from this source code are: the GNU
make utility and the GNU C compiler (gcc). Other C compilers may be used, but
may require small changes to the makefile, source files, or compilation
command-line. You will need to open a shell window to compile, install, and
run Mathomatic.

On a Debian or Ubuntu Linux computer, the "build-essential" and readline or
editline development packages "libreadline-dev" or "libeditline-dev" are
required to compile Mathomatic with readline functionality. To open a shell
window in desktop Linux, launch Applications/Accessories/Terminal.

To skip these compilation instructions and install an older version of
Mathomatic, already compiled and ready to run under Debian or Ubuntu, type:

	sudo apt-get install mathomatic mathomatic-primes

at the shell prompt, then type your password if prompted for it. You can then
run Mathomatic by typing "mathomatic". This is possible because Mathomatic is
an official Debian package. It is also an official Fedora package. To install
Mathomatic in Fedora Linux, type:

	sudo yum install mathomatic

To install Mathomatic in Gentoo Linux, type:

	sudo emerge mathomatic

The Mathomatic code is portable, self-testing, and easily compiles and
installs using the GNU utilities under Linux, Unix, SunOS, Mac OS X,
Microsoft Windows, and many modern mobile devices. Both the source code and
compiled, ready to run, binary packages may be available from your operating
system's package manager or from the Mathomatic website:
http://www.mathomatic.org/math/download.html


                     Typical compilation and installation
                     ------------------------------------

Root (super-user) authority is needed to install Mathomatic, because write
permission is needed to copy files into the directories in "/usr/local".
Mathomatic need not be installed to run the compiled executable. Reading the
makefile comments is recommended.

A typical compile/install is done by typing the following at the shell
prompt, while in the Mathomatic source code directory:

	make clean
	make READLINE=1    or    make EDITLINE=1
	make test
	sudo make install

and enter your password. That will compile the source code with readline
enabled, test the functionality of the generated executable (named
"mathomatic"), and install the executable, docs, and tests in "/usr/local" in
less than a minute. After that, typing "man mathomatic" should bring up the
man page, and typing "mathomatic" should run Mathomatic. If Mathomatic
doesn't run, check that the PATH environment variable includes
"/usr/local/bin" with the shell command "echo $PATH".

To install in "/usr" instead of "/usr/local", type:

	sudo make prefix=/usr install

sudo asks you for your password; if it doesn't work, login as root or type:

	su -c "make install"

and enter the root password to install as the super-user.


                                m4 Mathomatic
                                -------------

To install everything, including m4 Mathomatic (rmath), which allows easy
entry of math functions like sqrt(x) and sin(x) as macros, use "make
m4install" or "make m4install-degrees" instead of "make install". "make
m4install-degrees" sets degree mode instead of radian mode for trig
functions.


                              Prime Number Tools
                              ------------------

To clean, compile, test, and install the Mathomatic Prime Number Tools:

	cd primes
	make flush
	make
	./t
	sudo make install


                                  Uninstall
                                  ---------

To undo the installation, removing Mathomatic from the local computer, type:

	sudo make uninstall
