; Tests for the experimental limit command.

clear all
; find the derivative of:
y = 1/(x^.5)
; using the difference quotient:
y' = (1/(x+delta_x)^.5-1/x^.5)/delta_x
limit delta_x 0 ; take the limit as delta_x (change in x) goes to 0
3
integrate x ; take the antiderivative to see if it's right
compare 1

; test infinity limits:
2x/(x+1)
limit x inf ; answer should be 2

(3x+100-a)/(x-b)
limit x inf ; answer should be 3

(((x^2) - (5*x) + 6)^(1/2)) - x
limit x inf ; answer should be -5/2

x*((x^2+1)^.5-x)
limit x inf ; answer should be 1/2

1/x^2+1/x
limit y inf ; result should be original expression with a warning.
limit x inf ; result should be 0

((2*(x^2)) - x - 6)/((x^2) + (2*x) - 8)
limit x inf ; result should be 2

x^2+x
limit x 0 ; result should be 0
limit x 2 ; result should be 6

; The following currently gives the wrong answer:
limit x inf ; result should be inf
; The following currently gives errors:
y=x+1/x
:limit x 0 ; result should be inf
:limit x inf; result should be inf
