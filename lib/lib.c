 *
 * matho_init(3) must have been called only one time before this
 * to initialize the Mathomatic symbolic math engine.
 * Use matho_clear(3) as many times as you want to restart Mathomatic
 * for the next group of operations.
 *
 * This function works just like typing something into the Mathomatic prompt.
 * To only parse any expression or equation and store it, use matho-parse(3).
 *
 * If this returns true (non-zero), the command or input was successful,
 * and the resulting expression output string is stored in "*outputp".
 * That is a malloc()ed text string which must be free()d after use
 * to return the memory used by the string.
 * The equation number of the equation space that the output expression
 * is additionally stored in (if any) is available in the global "result_en",
 * otherwise result_en = -1.
 *
 * If this returns false, the command or input failed and a text error
 * message is always stored in "*outputp".
 * The error message is a constant string and should NOT be free()d.
 *
 * Some commands, like the set command, will return no output when successful,
 * setting "*outputp" to NULL.
 *
 * The resulting output string can safely be ignored by calling
 * this function with "outputp" set to NULL.
